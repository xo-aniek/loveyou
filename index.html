<h1>I love you</h1>
 <div>
  <p>I hid letters within the photoalbum you got.</p>
  <p>These letters can be used to unlock something.</p>
  <p>Find the letters, write them down, open <a href="https://accounts.google.com/signin/v2/identifier?hl=nl&continue=https%3A%2F%2Fmail.google.com%2Fmail&service=mail&flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=AddSession">this link</a> and fill the letters in.</p>
  <p>Good luck <3</p>

  <p>You might have noticed that you will need a password now.</p>
  <p>And maybe you already know it, but if you dont...</p>
  <p>Go get the photoalbum again and read the introduction text again.</p>
  <p>If you read it good enough you should know the password.</p>
  <p>If you don't know you might need some better eyes xo</p>
  <p>In case you still haven't found the password you are allowed to ask.</p>
 </div>
 
 <div>
  <p>Fill in the password and check the emails you've recieved.</p>
  <p>Hope you like it</p>
  <h3>I love you</h3>
